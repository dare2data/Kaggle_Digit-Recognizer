# Kaggle_Digit-Recognizer
### Problem 
The main Goal to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. 

### Apporach
Used Tenserflow with Neural Network. I took three hidden layers and used RELU activation function for hidden layers and SOFTMAX activation function for output layer. Took batch size for input was 100. For optimisation i used AdamOptimizer with learning late 0.01.

### Findings 
98.32% digits correctly identified
